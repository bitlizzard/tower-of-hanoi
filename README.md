# Tower of Hanoi

Classic Tower of Hanoi game logic with step-by-step moves. This program prints the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle for a given number of disks.

## Features

- Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with any number of disks given by user input. 
- Implores the printing of step-by-step move instructions to accurately solve it. 
- The program involves implementation of the chrono library as an exercise in benchmarking. 
- Demonstrates use of vectors and stacks to simulate the physical rods in the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- Demonstrates the use of recursion to solve the problem as opposed to iteratively.

## Notes And Learning
- The choice to create the Tower of Hanoi solution was to recieve a solid understanding on the concept of recursion.
- Additionally as I went on I implemented use of the chrono library to then benchmark the solution, for use in future projects.
- Challanges faces in the creation of this project involved the implementation recursion logic, as well as using stacks to simulate the rods due to weaknesses in understanding data structures.
- Please note in the above screenshots I had effectively commented out the printrods function so I could compare runtimes for the simulation with and without console output.
